  desc: Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. It's also a plant
    (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee plant
    is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is
    usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in Ethiopia, and now also
    grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia. They are an important
    crop for the economies of many countries.
