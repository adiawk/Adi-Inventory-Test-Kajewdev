  desc: 'A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Australian English: patty cake
    or cup cake,) is a small cake designed to be eaten by one person. They are often
    baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. Like larger cakes, frosting and
    other cake decorations, such as sprinkles, are common on cupcakes. They are often
    sweet and include frosting. Some specialized bakeries sell only cupcakes.'
